### Some conversation starters questions in case you need them

* What are the items ingested?
* How are they ingested?
* Are there some requirements?
* Is there a selection of material, if so, who takes care of it? How does the process look like?
* What structure of data organizations could the Unarchive have? Can we reuse or steal something from existing database sytems?
